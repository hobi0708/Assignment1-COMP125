            <li >Making Games</li>
            <p class="content">One of my favourite project in this Software Engineering Interactive-Gaming is to make games.
                At first, I did not know a single code <br>about computer language. When I started to learn each steps, it was fun 
                but also hard. When I started to learn how to create things<br> with Unity I felt really thrilling. One day, I want to 
                create all my games what I dreamed of.
            </p>
            <li>Understanding new codes and using it.</li>
            <p class="content">Learning computer langauge is fun but also hard. It is hard to do when you do not know how it works.
                 During the course, I learned <br>from basic understanding. When I build a code, it gives me a headache when I fail to do 
                 what I expected. But when I understand and<br> success building the code, it gives me a satisfaction, that I really understand 
                 how it works.
            </p>
            <li>Projects with teams</li>
            <p class="content">Doing a project with others is one of my favourite project in this course. When you do a project alone, you have
                 to think about <br>everything by yourself. However, if you have other friends to do together, it can be much helpful. I also like 
                 to listen to what other<br> people think, because sometimes they say things that I never thought about. Also another good thing about
                 doing a project in team<br> is that you can meet new people who can be friends with you.
